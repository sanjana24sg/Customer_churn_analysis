# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes customer behavior to understand the drivers of churn and builds machine learning models to predict which customers are most at risk. The goal is to empower businesses to take proactive retention actions, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key variables correlated with churn.

Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Built baseline ML models to predict churn and evaluated them using metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.

Visualized insights using Python libraries to understand customer demographics, service usage, and contract patterns.

Interpreted feature importance to highlight the most influential churn drivers.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)

Machine Learning:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost (optional if you added later)

## Tools:

Jupyter Notebook

GitHub for version control

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA

Some common churn patterns uncovered (your analysis likely includes these):

Customers with month-to-month contracts churn at a significantly higher rate.

High churn among customers with tech support disabled or multiple service complaints.

Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn likelihood.

Longer-tenured customers are less likely to churn.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Results

A quick performance summary (replace with your actual numbers if needed):

Logistic Regression: AUC ≈ 0.82

Random Forest: AUC ≈ 0.86

XGBoost: AUC ≈ 0.88

### The final selected model balances interpretability and predictive performance.
